What is this project?
--> This is my attempt at creating the pac-man game, simple as that.
    It is not yet completely finished, it has only one level.
    Although it lacks more levels the game logic is complete all the ghosts have their AI working, the game
    knows how to switch from different states and the winning conditions work

One teeny tiny problem:
--> Keyboard might not work sometimes when opening the game.
    This is a bug that I really didn't know how to fix yet but will surely fix it when I find the cause.
    If you have any idea how to help me fix it please post it as an issue or send me an email at ahemdhoussemayachi@gmail.com

How to run?
--> Compile all classes and run Main/app.java or simply let your favourite IDE handle the work
